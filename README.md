# Bookmark-Classifier
A way to automatically classify bookmarks into different categories
This is a very initial step to automate the way our bookmarks are stored. The main motive behind our project was to 
automatically classify the bookmarks so that the users would not have to go through the trouble of doing that manually.

At an initial stage we have decided six categories, namely - news, sports, songs, blogs, entertainment, education. These we
felt were the most visited genres by students. 

In the code, mainly the path of the files have to be taken care of,.
